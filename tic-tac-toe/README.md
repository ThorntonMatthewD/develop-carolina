# Exercise: Create Tic-Tac-Toe

For this assignment we had to create a simple tic-tac-toe game in three different programming languages.

I chose Python to get things off of the ground and to be able to take an OO approach. I did the other two in C and Rust. This was my first time using Rust, and it wasn't at all how I expected it to be. It is **very** strongly typed, and I wasn't sure which libraries to use from most tasks. I tried a couple different ways of reading in from stdin, and I'm not sure yet which (if either) is best. I hope to go back and clean it up once I learn more about Rust's best practices, but the game works and that's all I can really ask for right now.

## Running Each Game

Python: `python ttt.py`

C: `gcc ttt.c -o ttt && ./ttt`

Rust: `rustc ttt.rs && ./ttt`
